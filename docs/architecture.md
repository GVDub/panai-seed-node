 # PanAI Seed Node Architecture
 
 ## Overview
 
 PanAI is designed as a decentralized, ethically grounded AI framework for memory, reflection, and coordination across distributed systems. Its architecture prioritizes local-first processing, modular design, and extensible node-to-node communication.

 ## Core Components
 
 ### ðŸ§  Memory API
 A FastAPI-based microservice responsible for:
 - Logging user/system-generated memory entries
 - Performing reflection, summarization, and advice generation
 - Embedding and storing vectors in a local Qdrant instance
 
 ### ðŸ”„ Chat and Inference Services
 - Dynamic model selection based on task type
 - Lightweight inference endpoints for multi-modal or multi-model reasoning
 - Designed to plug into Ollama or local llama.cpp infrastructure
 
 ### ðŸ”— Node Mesh
 - Each PanAI instance can query others on the LAN via REST API
 - Supports future peer validation and routing strategies
 - Node registry (`nodes.json`) stores peer metadata and health info

 ## Trust and Audit Layer (Planned)
 
 ### ðŸ§¾ Merkle Anchored Audit Logs
 
 To ensure memory immutability and provenance:
 - Logs are hashed periodically into a Merkle tree
 - The root hash is written to a blockchain (or mock chain in early phases)
 - Each node retains a local mapping of memory â†’ Merkle proof â†’ TX hash
 
 This architecture supports lightweight, verifiable audit trails without requiring full on-chain storage.

   end
 ```

 ## Planned Enhancements
 
 - Secure cross-node memory sharing via signed payloads
 - Optional ZK-proofs or pseudonymous keys for log commitments
 - Dedicated Anchor Microservice for real-time Merkle tracking
 - CLI tools to recompute and verify historic checkpoints

 ## Philosophy
 
 PanAI isnâ€™t just about distributed AIâ€”itâ€™s about trusted cognition. By pairing reflection with transparency, and privacy with verifiability, it sets a path for ethical, persistent, and adaptive AI systems.
