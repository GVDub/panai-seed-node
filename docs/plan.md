# Action Plan for Session `2024-04-18-test`

## 1. Establish Logging Standards
- **1.1**: Use a consistent timestamp format (`YYYY-MM-DD`) for all log entries.
- **1.2**: Maintain single-purpose change logs to clearly separate actions.
- **1.3**: Apply consistent naming (e.g., "The memory API") across entries.
- **1.4**: Adopt structured logging formats (JSON or key-value) where feasible for easier parsing and analysis.

## 2. Enhance Logging Details
- **2.1**: Encourage descriptive logging that explains the reason behind changes.
- **2.2**: Promote documentation-quality logs to support onboarding and future reference.
- **2.3**: Prefer logging data objects over strings when meaningful (e.g., dicts for request/response payloads).

## 3. Foster Technical Depth
- **3.1**: Keep highlighting internal system improvements and enhancements.
- **3.2**: Capture developer reasoning to promote transparency and insight.
- **3.3**: Capture major architectural decisions in commit messages and log summaries.

## 4. Promote Proactive Maintenance
- **4.1**: Refactor and optimize proactively to preempt technical debt.
- **4.2**: Encourage recognition for forward-looking contributions.

## 5. Establish Regular Log Reviews
- **5.1**: Host bi-weekly or monthly log review sessions.
- **5.2**: Use these to identify trends, share practices, and document learnings.

## 6. Expand Logging Scope
- **6.1**: Consider whether broader system updates should be logged.
- **6.2**: Capture both internal system events and externally relevant user-facing changes, including new APIs, memory behaviors, or federated activity.

## 7. Monitor and Adapt
- **7.1**: Analyze logs for patterns and insights.
- **7.2**: Continuously evolve logging practices based on findings.
- **7.3**: Periodically revise logging guidelines to reflect current best practices.

## 8. Retrieval and Review

- **8.1**: Retrieve plans programmatically using Qdrant tag-based filtering:
    ```python
    from qdrant_client import QdrantClient

    client = QdrantClient(host="localhost", port=6333)

    results = client.scroll(
        collection_name="panai_memory",
        scroll_filter={
            "must": [
                {"key": "tags", "match": {"value": "plan"}},
                {"key": "log_type", "match": {"value": "plan"}}
            ]
        },
        limit=5
    )

    for point in results[0]:
        print(point.payload)
    ```

- **8.2**: Include plan entries in memory review sessions to evaluate implementation progress and update next steps.
- **8.3**: Include a `log_type` tag (`plan`, `reflection`, `debug`, etc.) to filter by entry purpose.
