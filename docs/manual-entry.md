# Manual Memory Entry Guide

This document outlines the process for manually logging a memory to the PanAI memory system via the `/log_memory` endpoint. This is useful for entering key insights, quotes, or conceptual seeds that should persist in the system.

---

## ðŸ“¥ API Endpoint

**POST** `/log_memory`

This route accepts both ephemeral and persistent memories depending on server config.

### Required JSON fields:

- `text` (string): The memory content you want to log.
- `session_id` (string) (optional): A unique identifier to group related memories. You can reuse a session or create a new one. If omitted, a timestamp-based session will be generated.
- `tags` (list of strings): Keywords or topics that help categorize and retrieve the memory later. This can be empty but is strongly recommended.

## ðŸ§  Example

Hereâ€™s an example of a manually entered philosophical axiom that was logged via this process:

```json
{
  "text": "That which is forgotten still exerts force.\nSo does that which is yet undiscovered.\n\nTogether, they feel like the axioms of PanAIâ€™s worldviewâ€”maybe even the first two entries in its evolving Credo or Founderâ€™s Scroll. Not rules. Not laws. Just recognitions of weight.",
  "session_id": "2024-04-16-credo",
  "tags": ["philosophy", "credo", "axiom", "panai"]
}
```

## ðŸ”„ How to Submit

You can enter the memory manually in two ways:

### Using Swagger UI

1. Open `http://localhost:8000/docs`
2. Find the `POST /log_memory` section
3. Click **"Try it out"**
4. Paste your JSON payload into the request body
5. Click **"Execute"**
6. If the memory was logged successfully, youâ€™ll see a confirmation response with `status: success` and the memory's internal ID.

### Using cURL (terminal)

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/log_memory \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "text": "That which is forgotten still exerts force.\nSo does that which is yet undiscovered.\n\nTogether, they feel like the axioms of PanAIâ€™s worldviewâ€”maybe even the first two entries in its evolving Credo or Founderâ€™s Scroll. Not rules. Not laws. Just recognitions of weight.",
    "session_id": "2024-04-16-credo",
    "tags": ["philosophy", "credo", "axiom", "panai"]
  }'
```

## ðŸ“Œ Tips

- **Use session IDs** like `YYYY-MM-DD-topic` to help organize memory logs chronologically or by theme.
- **Tag thoroughly** to improve retrieval via `/search_by_tag`.
- **Avoid duplicate IDs**: A unique `id` will be generated automatically using timestamp logic.
- Entries logged this way are stored using the same embedding model and pipeline as live interactions.
- If the system supports reflection or dreaming, tagged manual entries may influence future thought loops.

This method ensures persistence of critical insights and creates a durable thought trail.

## ðŸ”® Future Possibilities

- Manual entries could include `importance` or `urgency` flags to influence prioritization.
- Optionally mark memories as `public` or `private` for federated sharing logic.
- Enable journaling modes that auto-tag entries as `meta`, `review`, or `summary`.
