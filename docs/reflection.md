# Reflection Module

The `reflection` endpoint in the PanAI Seed Node is responsible for generating higher-order insights from previously logged memories. It enables the system to analyze, synthesize, and interpret stored experiences to produce deeper understanding and pattern recognition.

## Purpose

Reflection is designed to simulate metacognitive behaviorâ€”thinking about thinking. It looks at memories not just as individual data points, but as a connected set of ideas that can yield insights, recognize shifts in behavior or intent, and prepare the system for more contextualized responses in the future.

## Endpoint

**POST** `/reflect`

### Request Body

```json
{
  "session_id": "2024-04-15-demo",
  "limit": 5
}
```

### Response

```json
{
  "session_id": "2024-04-15-demo",
  "reflection": "Based on the memory log, several recurring themes emerge..."
}
```

## Methodology

The system performs the following steps:
1. Retrieves recent or session-specific memories from the Qdrant vector database.
2. Concatenates and summarizes those memories into a coherent context.
3. Generates a reflection using a local LLM (e.g., `mistral-nemo`) via an internal prompt template.
4. Logs the generated reflection back into memory with appropriate metadata and tags.

## Use Cases

- Surfacing behavioral patterns or biases
- Identifying overlooked connections or themes
- Supporting journaling or summarization workflows
- Building self-awareness into AI agents

## Future Enhancements

- Weighting memories by recency or semantic relevance
- Comparing new reflections with past reflections to detect growth or change
- Allowing custom reflection styles (e.g., analytical, philosophical, empathetic)
